This course is also a part of the [Full-Stack Web Developer Certificate](https://www.gtc.edu/programs/certificates/it-full-stack-web-developer) being offered at [Gateway Technical College](http://gtc.edu).

## Course Description
This course will introduce students how to add intuitive, dynamic and animated interaction between their web pages and visitors. Using HTML5 as a base, we will use JavaScript, AJAX, and jQuery library to react to user actions and change webpage structure, content, and appearance. Through this course, students will learn how to dynamically refine design appearance, control and manipulate HTML elements via the DOM API, and create content within a medium that is used for both desktop and mobile device computing.
